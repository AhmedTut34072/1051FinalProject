Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Device vulnerability scanner, Student study app

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

a program that scans devices for vulnerablities such as weak passwords and open ports.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will be an application that can be installed on computers or mobile devices that scans and detects safety isuues and offers solutions. 
This will be made with a python code, allowing users to initiate scans, view results, and save scan reports.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would 
relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A program that scans passwords and idetifies if theyre weak.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A program that scans passwords and networks and idetifies any issues and offers solutions.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A program that scans passwords, networks, and open ports idetifies issues offers solutions and implements them. 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps include lerning how to make a scanner, making a interface thats user-friendly, and adding network features. Skills Needed: Learning how to run
multiple scans at once (multi-threading) and working with Tkinter (for the interface). Research Topics: Learning about basic network protocols and common 
vulnerabilities will make the scanner more realistic. We can also look into using charts to show results clearly. betweeen me and Yusuf one of us will work on 
making the application and user interface while the other writes the code for the scanner and other features.
